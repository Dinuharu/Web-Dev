    <h1>Poem</h1>
    <p>Beneath the sky so vast and blue,<br>
The world awaits with things to do.<br>
A whispered breeze, a quiet stream,<br>
Life unfolds, a waking dream.<br>

Each step we take, a story grows,<br>
Through highs and lows, the river flows.<br>
So cherish moments, big and small,<br>
For theyâ€™re the threads that weave it all.</p>
